## JDBC

Can be downloaded from:

> https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.zip

In IntelliJ, you can access libraries for a project going to `File` --> `Project Structure ...` and then by navigating to `Libraries` under `Project Settings`.

Here you can add the downloaded .ZIP-file, which will now make classes such as `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` available
